                <p>When my wedding dates were fixed, I was so happy.
                    I barely realised , I just have one month to stay with my parents, waking up late and not being
                    judged, talking loudly , shouting and fighting with my siblings, asking for money from dad without
                    any hesitation, not cooking or doing any household works, being a lazyass, staying late at cousins,
                    going shopping anytime with ammu and thousands and thousands things!
                    Won’t be addressed as my father’s daughter but husband’s wife, this whole thing of changing guardian
                    ship.
                    Won’t wake up on the Eid day seeing my parents and siblings. Won’t clean my house on chand raat and
                    go out with friends or cousins.
                    Will have to live according to the new rules,mentality,economy,circumstances apart from my Abbus.
                    Need to change the lifestyle that my parents gave just within a blink of eyes. Staying at my home
                    for a long time will be illegal and unethical.
                    It’s not like I’m the only girl who’s getting married in this whole world but Little did I
                    realise,my life will be changed forever.</p>
